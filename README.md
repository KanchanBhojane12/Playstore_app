This project focuses on examining thousands of Google Play Store applications along with their user reviews to extract meaningful insights and understand the relationships between different app features. Two datasets—Apps and User Reviews—are used to study how attributes such as app price, size, number of installs, and category are connected. In addition, user reviews for each app are analyzed to identify their overall composition and to examine the distribution of sentiment polarity.
